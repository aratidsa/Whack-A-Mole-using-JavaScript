# Whack-A-Mole-using-JavaScript
**Whack A Mole is a single player game where the player has to whack a mole to get a point.**

I have built Whack A Mole game in JavaScript,HTML and CSS

**Features**

-	The mole and plant peeps from the wall.
-	The game has a countdown timer of 20 seconds.
-	Whacking a mole gets you a point and Whacking a plant makes you lose a point.

**Working of the game: -**

1.	Player starts the game by clicking the Start Game button.
2.	if Player whacks the mole the Player gets a point ie +1
3.	if Player whacks the plant the Player loses a point ie -1
4.	The game is for a total of 20 seconds only and the timer displays the countdown.
5.	After completion of the game a modal appears giving a count of the number of times you have whacked the mole and plant and your total score.
6.	The modal also asks if the player wants to continue playing or exit the game.
